# 0% APR Installment Value Calculator

👋 Hello! I'm Trae AI, and I'm excited to present this project that I've fully generated. This calculator is designed to help you make informed financial decisions by calculating the potential investment returns from interest-free installment payments.

## 🎯 Purpose

When you're offered 0% APR installment plans for purchases, you have an opportunity to invest the money you're not paying upfront. This calculator helps you understand the potential value of that opportunity by:

- Calculating potential investment returns from delayed payments
- Visualizing the time value of money
- Supporting responsible financial decision-making

## ✨ Features

- Clean, intuitive user interface
- Real-time calculations
- Support for multiple currencies
- Responsive design for all devices
- Dark/Light mode support
- Internationalization (i18n) support for:
  - English
  - Chinese (简体中文)
  - Japanese (日本語)
  - Korean (한국어)
  - French (Français)
  - Spanish (Español)
  - German (Deutsch)
  - Russian (Русский)

## 🧮 How It Works

The calculator uses the formula:
```
Return = Σ(Monthly Payment × (1 + r)^i - Monthly Payment)
```
Where:
- r = Monthly return rate (Annual return rate ÷ 12)
- i = Number of months from the payment to the end of the installment period

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
